# AWS FSx ONTAP CloudFormation Resource Types

This collection of [AWS CloudFormation resource types][1] allow management of ONTAP entities to be controlled using [AWS CloudFormation][2]. As for now the collection of resources is under private preview and can be activated using a key. In order to acquire a key please email [NetApp](mailto:Ng-fsx-cloudformation@netapp.com?subject=CloudFormation%20Resource%20Provider%20key)

See the [end-user documentation](docs/user/generated) including:

* [examples](docs/user/generated/stories)
* [supported GitHub resource types](docs/user/generated/resources)

There is also [developer documentation](docs/dev) available
if you are interested in building or contributing.

## Prerequisites

* [AWS Account][14]
* [AWS CLI][15]
* API Key
* Deploy a Link

A Link is an entity (Lambda) that act as a proxy between the CloudFormation service and the FSxN. The Link need to be deployed in a VPC that has connectivity to the managment endpoint of the FSXn. A single Link can be used for all FSXn (as long as there is connectivity) and for all resources.

## Activate Link Module

1. Sign in to the [AWS Management Console][11] with your account and navigate to CloudFormation.

2. Select "Public extensions" from the left hand pane and filter Extension type ny Module and Publisher by "Third Party".

3. Use the search bar to filter by the "NetApp" prefix.

4. Select the Link module to view more information about its schema, and click **Activate**.

5. On the **Extension details** page, specify:

* Extension name
* Execution role ARN
* Automatic updates for minor version releases
* Configuration

6. After you have your Link module configured, [create your AWS stack][12] and use the ARN as input for the ```LinkArn``` input parameter.

## AWS Management Console

To get started:

1. Sign in to the [AWS Management Console][11] with your account and navigate to CloudFormation.

2. Select "Public extensions" from the left hand pane and filter Publisher by "Third Party".

3. Use the search bar to filter by the "NetApp" prefix.

  Note: All official  Netapp resources begin with `NetApp::FSxN` and specify that they are `Published by NetApp`.

4. Select the desired resource name to view more information about its schema, and click **Activate**.

5. On the **Extension details** page, specify:

* Extension name
* Execution role ARN
* Automatic updates for minor version releases
* Configuration

6. In your terminal, specify the configuration data for the registered Netapp CloudFormation resource type, in the given account and region by using the **SetTypeConfiguration** operation:

  For example:

  ```Bash
  $ aws cloudformation set-type-configuration \z`
  --region us-west-2 --type RESOURCE \
  --type-name NetApp::FSxN::CifsShare \
  --configuration-alias default \
  --configuration "{\"PreviewKey\":\"YOURPREVIEWKEY\"}"
  ```

7. After you have your resource configured, [create your AWS stack][12] that includes any of the activated ONTAP resources.

For more information about available commands and workflows, see the official [AWS documentation][13].
